# 2016-PIC-Math-Project
noninferiority hypothesis testing, categorical three-level endpoint, forest plot, confidence intervals

Done with a classmate as part of the PIC Math (Preparation for Industrial Careers in Mathematics) program at Fresno State. Using local hospital, we tested an experimental dosage of Curosurf against a historical cohort. The test was a non-inferiority hypothesis test, where we had to choose the NI-margin. Giving a weighted value to the middle clinical outcome enabled us to show non-inferiority. All analysis was done in R. The files shown here are the R code, manuscript, plots, and Prezi presentation of the research.
